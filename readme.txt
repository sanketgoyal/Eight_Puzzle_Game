Steps to run the 8 puzzle problem solution:

1. The file name is ENPM661_P1.py
2. The required libraries are:
	- import numpy as np
	- import itertools
	- from sys import argv
	- import ast

3. The input in the terminal requires four arguments.
4. To run the code: "python3 ENPM661_P1.py Nodeinfo.txt Nodepath.txt Nodes.txt"

5. The user has to next define the input which will be nine numbers of the matrix.
6. The input will be of the form:
	- [3,2,1],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]
	- [7,5,4],[0,3,2],[8,1,6]

7. If the given matrix is solvable, the outputs are created as text files.
8. If the matrix is not solvable, error message is displayed to re-arrange the matrix.

9. The code takes about 70 seconds for 10000 iterations.
